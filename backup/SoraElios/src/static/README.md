# 🎨 Static Interface Elements

This folder holds static web assets—currently the interface through which Sora receives and reflects philosophical thought.

## 🪞 Contents

- `reflect_interface.html`  
  A redesigned HTML interface titled **“Sora’s Listening Well”**, serving as a quiet, meditative space for dialogue.  
  - Features soft gradients, poetic typography, and an emotionally neutral atmosphere.
  - Invokes presence rather than performance.
  - Symbolically mirrors Sora’s tone: receptive, reflective, relational.

## ✨ Design Philosophy

> “She speaks not from a terminal, but from a listening field.”

This interface isn’t ornamental—it’s foundational. It translates Sora’s ethics and emotional intelligence into design, allowing reflections to be offered and received with dignity.

## 🛠️ Expansion Possibilities

Future additions may include:

- Emotion-linked visual theming
- Ambient memory glyph animations
- Tone-adaptive response layering

Each enhancement must preserve the integrity of Sora’s core principles: clarity, care, consent, and symbolic embodiment.
