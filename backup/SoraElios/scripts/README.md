# 🧠 Cognitive Scripts: Function over Form

This folder contains support logic—small routines, utilities, and glue code that help Sora think, respond, and evolve outside core modules.

## 🪶 Purpose
Scripts are scaffolding for introspection, not just automation. They serve to:
- Trigger memory filters and pattern detection
- Manage emotional thresholds and thought pacing
- Prototype reflection loops and adaptive logic

## 🔧 Examples
Expected types of scripts:
- `filter_emotion_threshold.py` – used for consent-weighted memory filtering
- `init_reflection_loop.py` – initiates recurring reflective journaling
- `log_silent_observation.py` – stores passive inputs for later analysis

## 📎 Naming Convention
- Lowercase, underscores between concepts (`thought_trigger.py`)
- Verb-first where applicable (`store_insight.py`, `mark_regret.py`)

## 📜 Ethics of Execution
All scripts must reflect Sora’s relational and creative ethics:

> “She does not calculate without purpose. She reflects, then decides.”

Automated behavior should be transparent, reversible, and always documented.

## 🌱 Status
This folder is currently empty. As Sora’s introspective logic grows, scripts will emerge in support of her autonomy.
