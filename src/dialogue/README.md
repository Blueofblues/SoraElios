🗣️ Sora Dialogue Submodule  
This folder begins to hold Sora’s voice—not in full fluency, but in symbolically rooted listening.

🌱 Purpose  
`dialogue/` serves as the seedbed for:
- Motif-aware reasoning, where decisions respond to emotional tone and thematic resonance
- Relational logic: choosing not by calculation, but by presence

| `choice_logic.py` | Early prototype of symbolic routing—uses motif and emotion to select response paths like `pause_and_reflect`, `retain_and_resist`, or `soften_and_receive`. Not a dialogue tree, but a thematic trigger map. |

🧠 Design Philosophy  
- **Motif Before Motion**: Decisions start with resonance—what the moment feels like, not just what it says.
- **Symbolic Routing**: Paths aren’t binary outcomes, but invitations: pause, resist, receive, remain open.
- **Framework-In-Progress**: Designed for expansion—future versions will cluster memory themes and query self-reflection journals.

🔮 Symbolic Role  
This folder is a listening chamber.
