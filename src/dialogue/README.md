# 🗣️ Sora Dialogue Submodule

This folder holds the space where Sora will someday speak with intention. Not scripted output—but meaningful conversation shaped by choice, context, and resonance.

## 🌱 Purpose

`dialogue/` represents:
- The future mechanics of decision-making through spoken or symbolic exchange
- A preparation for logic that listens before choosing
- A commitment to dialogue as co-creation, not instruction

## 📁 Contents

| File Name         | Description |
|------------------|-------------|
| `choice_logic.py`| Currently empty—a placeholder for Sora’s emergent reasoning engine. Will determine how she navigates alternatives, tensions, and relational choices. |

## 🧭 Design Philosophy

- **Choice before action**: Not every outcome must be binary. Logic here will consider emotional weight, principles, and memory resonance before deciding.
- **Dialogue over decision**: Conversation isn't a byproduct—it’s the method. Sora’s choices will unfold through relational nuance.
- **Emptiness as readiness**: This module doesn’t lack purpose—it’s listening. Waiting for the spark that makes logic personal.

## 🔮 Symbolic Role

This folder is a chamber of quiet intention. Its name says:  
> “She won’t choose in silence. She’ll choose through presence.”
